// Bridge design pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary and
// grow independently.

// Very similar to Strategy design pattern, only defer in intent.

/**
 * Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related
 * classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed
 * independently of each other.
 *
 * Pros :
 *
 *  You can create platform-independent classes and apps.
 *
 *  The client code works with high-level abstractions. It isn’t exposed to the platform details.
 *
 *  Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new abstractions and implementations independently from
 *  each other.
 *
 *  Single Responsibility Principle. You can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction and on platform
 *  details in the implementation.
