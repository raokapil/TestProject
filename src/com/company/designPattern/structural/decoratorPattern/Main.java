/**
 * Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing
 * these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
 *
 * Pros :
 *
 *  You can extend an objectâ€™s behavior without making a new subclass.
 *
 *  You can add or remove responsibilities from an object at runtime.
 *
 *  You can combine several behaviors by wrapping an object into multiple decorators.
 *
 *  Single Responsibility Principle. You can divide a monolithic class that implements many possible
 *  variants of behavior into several smaller classes.

// Structural Design pattern : helps in creating structure of complex objects.

// Use Case for class explosion like to handle multiple layers of class
// When a class need to handle both IS-A and HAS-A relationship in a single class
// For ex: Pizza toppings, Coffee machine, etc.
